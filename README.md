# __Pork Paradice__
## co-authored by Araceli Valdovinos, Erika Debelis, and James Benjamin Pawlik 

### __Description__
Pork Paradice is an exciting game of chance and strategy. The porcine players take turns rolling the dice. Each roll puts them closer to Hog Heaven but risks a trip to an eternal, infernal BBQ.

Rules:
1. A player rolls a six-sided die.
2. If the roll is one, the player's turn ends and they receive no points.
3. Otherwise, the player adds the roll to their total score and rolls again.
4. A prudent porker may choose to Hold, adding their score to their total. A greedy grunter can keep on rollin' in the mud.
5. The first player to reach 100 points wins!

### __Technologies Used__
